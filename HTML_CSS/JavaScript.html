                <p>
                    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, 
                    weakly typed. prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interperted programming language.
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide 
                    Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,
                     including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support
                     it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many
                     JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the 
                     EMCAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many
                     engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
